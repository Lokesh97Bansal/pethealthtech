Continue building and refining the homepage of my smart pet care website. Focus on the following detailed improvements to create an emotionally powerful, visually stunning, and data-backed storytelling experience.
üî• 1. Content Quality & Visual Enhancement for Each Section
For Every Section:

Add rich, emotionally resonant copy that connects pet owners deeply with their pets' experiences.
Use high-quality, emotionally evocative visuals for each scene (e.g., dogs waiting at the door, pets protecting children, pets playing joyfully, pets looking sad or isolated when sick).
Integrate smooth, scroll-triggered animations for text, images, and statistics (use fade-ins, slide-ins, and parallax effects where appropriate).
Use Tailwind CSS for all styling with a soft, warm color palette (beige, pastel tones, light creams) to maintain emotional resonance.
Ensure all sections are fully responsive and visually balanced on desktop and mobile.
Implement consistent padding, spacing, and typography (use Poppins or Lato fonts).
üìä 2. Data-Driven Stats Sections (PetHealthStatistics and PetStatsSection)
In PetHealthStatistics:

Build a visually striking stats section that presents the following:
61% of cats and 59% of dogs are overweight or obese (APOP, 2022).
Overweight pets can live up to 2.5 years less (Veterinary Practice UK, 2022).
10 million pets go missing each year (American Humane Society).
Microchipped pets are over 3 times more likely to be reunited.
Display each stat with animated number counters, visual icons, and smooth scroll-in effects.
Add supporting captions and small source references directly under each stat.
In PetStatsSection:

Build interactive infographic cards or circular progress bars for each stat.
Use engaging visual elements like:
Sad or isolated pets for the overweight stat.
Visual of a lost pet flyer for the lost pet stat.
Visual of a healthy vs overweight pet for the lifespan stat.
Use color-coded icons or charts to make the stats instantly understandable.
Ensure animations and counters trigger on scroll.
Add a References Block at the bottom of this section with clickable links:

üé¨ 3. Seamless Story Transitions and Emotional Flow

Transition Enhancements:

Use smooth scroll snapping to guide users naturally section by section.
Add parallax background effects where applicable (especially in the Hero and EmotionalConnection sections).
Ensure animation timing and fade-ins are staggered and elegant to keep the storytelling immersive.
Use soft anchor scrolls for navigation links (Home, For Vets, Smart Parenting Products, Blogs, Contact Us).
üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements:
Build using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS only.
Ensure full responsiveness across all devices.
Implement animation libraries like Framer Motion or use CSS-based Tailwind animations.
Maintain clean, organized component structure.
Prioritize accessibility (use proper alt tags, readable font sizes, and contrast ratios).
‚úÖ Bonus:
Optionally, add a floating 'Scroll to Top' button that appears after the user scrolls past the Hero section.
Consider adding light hover effects on buttons and cards to increase interactivity.
