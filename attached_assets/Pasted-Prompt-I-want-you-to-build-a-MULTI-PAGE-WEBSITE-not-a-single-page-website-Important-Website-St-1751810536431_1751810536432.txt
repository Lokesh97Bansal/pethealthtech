Prompt:
I want you to build a MULTI-PAGE WEBSITE, not a single-page website.
ðŸ”‘ Important Website Structure Requirements:

Build a multi-page website with separate pages and separate routes.
Each page must have its own URL and should be loaded independently.
DO NOT create a single-page multi-section website.
DO NOT create a website that just scrolls between sections.
Each page should be fully independent with its own HTML structure (or React Route).
Use either:
Separate HTML files (if using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
OR React Router with multiple route components (if using React)
Page Structure:
Home â†’ /home or index.html
About Us â†’ /about or about.html
Contact Us â†’ /contact or contact.html
Smart Parenting Products â†’ /products or products.html
Blogs â†’ /blogs or blogs.html
For Vets â†’ /forvets or forvets.html
Navbar Requirements:
The navbar must link to each page via a URL route, not scroll to sections.
Clicking on a navbar item must load the new page, not just jump or scroll.
Each page should have:
Its own header
Its own body content
Its own footer
Please confirm that you are building a MULTI-PAGE WEBSITE WITH SEPARATE PAGES, not a single-page multi-section website.
ðŸŽ¯ Smart Parenting Products Page Detailed Instructions

Build the Smart Parenting Products page for a pet health website, carefully following the design structure and layout of the page: https://www.fitbark.com/ with the following exact requirements:
ðŸ“Œ Section 1: Hero Section
Replicate the hero section layout from FitBarkâ€™s page.
Background: Large, high-quality pet image with colorful abstract graphics.
Text overlay: Use this rephrased text:

ðŸ“Œ Section 2: Supporting Partners
Replicate the supporting partners section from FitBarkâ€™s page.
Layout: Logos of media outlets and partners displayed horizontally.
Include Indian partners like YourStory, Economic Times, Hindustan Times, NDTV, Indian Express.
Make the code dynamic and easy to update by using a reusable component or an array-based structure to add/remove partners in the future without needing to change the HTML manually.
ðŸ“Œ Section 3: Feature Highlights with Smartphone Screens
Replicate the three-smartphone layout from FitBarkâ€™s page.
Design: Three phones side by side, each showing:
Live GPS Tracking
Location History
Health Monitoring
Each phone should have a hover animation or subtle scaling effect.
Below each screen, briefly describe the feature.
Make all images and text content easily replaceable via React props or simple data arrays.
ðŸ“Œ Section 4: Product Sections
Build one separate dedicated section per product:
C09: GPS Tracker
C08: Sleep & Health Monitor
Smart Feeder
Smart Littering Device
For Each Product:

Strictly follow the visual style of https://maven.pet/.
Layout:
Background image of a pet with pet parent.
Overlay text and graphical callouts directly on the photo using colored boxes, lines, or graphic pointers (exactly like Mavenâ€™s product feature style).
Each feature or benefit must be represented visually on the image.
For each feature, add a 'Learn More' link that points to the related Blog post.
After Features:

Add a product description.
Display a product star rating (similar to Amazonâ€™s style).
Add a 'Shop Now' button that links to a separate, product-specific shop page.
Ensure this layout is fully responsive and visually polished.
ðŸ“Œ Section 5: Additional Design Requirements
Use React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS only.
Implement smooth scrolling, fade-in animations, and subtle hover effects.
All sections should be modular, reusable, and easily updatable using React components and prop-based structures.
All navbar links must correctly route to the following pages:
Home
