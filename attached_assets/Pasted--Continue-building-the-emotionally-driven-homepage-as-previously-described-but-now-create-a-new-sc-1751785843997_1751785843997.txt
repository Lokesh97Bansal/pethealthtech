"Continue building the emotionally driven homepage as previously described, but now create a new scroll section that introduces research-backed statistics about pet health concerns. Design this section to feel visually connected to the emotional story above, but use clear, impactful infographics, percentage counters, and visual storytelling.
Structure this data section as follows:
ðŸ“Š Section: The Unspoken Pet Crisis
Heading: 'The Unspoken Pet Crisis: What the Studies Reveal'
Subheading: 'Our pets love us unconditionally, but are we giving them the care they deserve?'
Create three visually separated but connected parts (can be cards or horizontal scroll or vertical blocks):
Part 1: Obesity Crisis
Display this stat in large, bold text: '61% of cats and 59% of dogs are overweight or obese.'
Add a caption: 'Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP, 2022)'
Use an emotional image of an overweight but adorable pet.
Use a visual counter to animate the percentage.
Part 2: Hidden Health Risks
Show this stat: 'Overweight pets may live up to 2.5 years less.'
Add: 'Study: Veterinary Practice UK, 2022'
Show supporting text: 'Obesity increases the risk of diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease.'
Use minimal icons or infographics for these diseases.
Part 3: The Lost Pets Tragedy
Display: '10 million pets go missing each year.'
Add: 'Source: American Humane Society'
Show: 'Only 20% are reunited, but microchips triple their chances of returning home.'
Visual: A sad pet behind a fence or a lost poster graphic.
ðŸ“š Section: References
After the stats, include a simple list titled 'Sources and Studies' in smaller text at the bottom:
Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, 2022: petobesityprevention.org
Veterinary Practice UK, 2022: veterinary-practice.com
Banfield Pet Hospital Report, 2016: time.com

ðŸ’¡ Additional Design Instructions:
Use smooth fade-in animations for each stat as the user scrolls.
Keep the color scheme emotionally warm, consistent with the homepage.
Use modern, clean icons and charts (pie charts, progress circles, or animated counters).
Keep the section minimal but visually striking.
Make sure the page remains fully responsive on mobile and desktop.
