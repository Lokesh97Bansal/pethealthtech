Please continue building a MULTI-PAGE WEBSITE with separate routes and separate pages, not a single-page multi-section website.
🔑 Website Structure Reminder:

Each page must have its own URL and must load independently.
Navbar must link to pages, not sections.
Each page should have its own header, body, and footer.
Use React Router with multiple route components.
🚩 Focus Pages: “For Vets” and “Blogs”

The slider should loop infinitely and move automatically.
Section 2: Vet Testimonials
Display beautiful testimonials from the featured vets.
Include:
Vet photo

📋 Blogs Page Requirements:

Strictly replicate the design, layout, structure, and functionality of https://maven.pet/all-about-pets/.
Do not miss anything in:
Blog card design
Page responsiveness
Blog filters or categories
Blog linking behavior
Layout structure
When a user clicks on a blog post, a new blog detail page should open.
The blog detail page must follow the layout of Maven’s blog post detail pages.
Content Management System (CMS) Requirement:
Set up a backend structured repository or lightweight CMS that allows an authorized non-developer to add new blogs or edit existing blogs without touching the codebase.
Ensure:
Blog title, image, author, and body content can be updated via this system.
New blogs can be added easily through a form-based interface.
Recommended options:
Use JSON-based file storage (if staying lightweight)
Or use a simple headless CMS like Sanity, Strapi, or Firebase
Backend Requirements for Blogs:
Store blogs in a backend database.
Each blog should have:
Title
Featured image
Author
Date
Body content
Category/tags
Blogs should be searchable and filterable by category or keyword.
📋 Technical Requirements:

Use React Router for multi-page navigation.
Use React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
Ensure mobile responsiveness across all pages.
Ensure all navigation links open new pages, not just scroll.
Connect all forms to a backend database.
Set up backend APIs for:
Vet registration
Pet parent registration
Blog management
Include Google Maps distance calculation for vet proximity matching.
Use smooth animations (Framer Motion or Tailwind animation utilities).
Ensure all database and file structures are easy to update and scalable.
Please confirm that you are building a multi-page website with separate pages and independent loads, not a single-page scrolling site.
